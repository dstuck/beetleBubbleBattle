Bubble battle against your friends by popping them against the spikes. Switch between growing in size for greater force or shrinking down for maneuverability. Grab a shield to protect from spikes or a charge boost to really blast off.

Made for playing on an arcade cabinet like the ones at the Sea Cave, the game uses joystick plus one button controls to make it accessible for less experience game players (like my 4 year old).

This game can be played in browser at https://drawacard.itch.io/beetlebattlebubble though it requires external controllers since only one player can use the keyboard.
